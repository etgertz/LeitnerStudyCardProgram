***Welcome To My Leitner Study Card Program!***

As the title suggests, this project is modelled after the study system pioneered by Sebastian Leitner. 
By moving the flashcards to the next bin when correctly remembered and moving then down when incorrectly answered, this system allows the user to focus on the cards that need the most work,
while simultaniously increasing comprehension as the user is exposed to each card a proportional number of times to how well they know the term.

**Why I took on this project:**

I decided to take on this project since I enjoy the efficiency of creating study cards digitally, but was also interested in using the Leitner system, which my previous studying app didn't support.
I had initially planned to develop this program as a c# program for personal use. However, I also wanted to learn about web development with HTML, CSS and JS, so I
started developing this project as a way to familiarize myself with the basics of web development.

While I admit it may not be the cleanest code I've written I intend to continue to update and refine this application as I learn more about the best practices for developing with HTML, CSS and JS together.
